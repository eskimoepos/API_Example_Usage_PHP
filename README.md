# API
An API for the Eskimo EPOS

###Requirements
-----------

* [PHP Curl Class](https://github.com/php-curl-class/php-curl-class)
* If you decide to manually update the recipient database, [MeekroDB](https://github.com/SergeyTsalkov/meekrodb) is a simple and lightweight PHP MySQL Library ([further documentation](http://meekro.com/docs.php)).  This is useful for testing purposes and is used in the example code.


###Configuration and Notes 
-----------

Initial API setup and proof of concept with CSCart.  This is a work in progress and open to suggestions.

Configuration is contained within [eskimo.php](eskimo.php), but can moved to an alternative method.

A few simple examples have been provided for CSCart within [cscart.php](examples/cscart.php).
